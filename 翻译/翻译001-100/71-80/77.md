### 77."Preconditions" and logging arguments should not require evaluation

“先决条件”和日志参数不应该需要计算，换言之，在调用"Preconditions" 和 logging 方法时，参数应该是可确定的

Passing message arguments that require further evaluation into a Guava`com.google.common.base.Preconditions`check can result in a performance penalty. That's because whether or not they're needed, each argument must be resolved before the method is actually called.

Similarly, passing concatenated strings into a logging method can also incur a needless performance hit because the concatenation will be performed every time the method is called, whether or not the log level is low enough to show the message.

Instead, you should structure your code to pass static or pre-computed values into`Preconditions`conditions check and logging calls.

Specifically, the built-in string formatting should be used instead of string concatenation, and if the message is the result of a method call, then`Preconditions`should be skipped altoghether, and the relevant exception should be conditionally thrown instead.


**Noncompliant Code Example**

**错误的代码示例**

```
logger.log(Level.DEBUG, "Something went wrong: " + message);  // Noncompliant; string concatenation performed even when log level too high to show DEBUG messages

logger.fine("An exception occurred with message: " + message); // Noncompliant

LOG.error("Unable to open file " + csvPath, e);  // Noncompliant

Preconditions.checkState(a > 0, "Arg must be positive, but got " + a);  // Noncompliant. String concatenation performed even when a > 0

Preconditions.checkState(condition, formatMessage());  // Noncompliant. formatMessage() invoked regardless of condition

Preconditions.checkState(condition, "message: %s", formatMessage());  // Noncompliant
```

**Compliant Solution**

**正确的代码示例**


```
logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Something went wrong: {0} ", message);  // String formatting only applied if needed

logger.fine("An exception occurred with message: {}", message);  // SLF4J, Log4j

logger.log(Level.SEVERE, () -> "Something went wrong: " + message); // since Java 8, we can use Supplier , which will be evaluated lazily

LOG.error("Unable to open file {0}", csvPath, e);

if (LOG.isDebugEnabled() {
  LOG.debug("Unable to open file " + csvPath, e);  // this is compliant, because it will not evaluate if log level is above debug.
}

Preconditions.checkState(arg > 0, "Arg must be positive, but got %d", a);  // String formatting only applied if needed

if (!condition) {
  throw new IllegalStateException(formatMessage());  // formatMessage() only invoked conditionally
}

if (!condition) {
  throw new IllegalStateException("message: " + formatMessage());
}
```
