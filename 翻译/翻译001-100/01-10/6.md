### 6."@Deprecated" code should not be used

被@Deprecated 注解标注的代码不应该被使用.

Once deprecated, classes, and interfaces, and their members should be avoided, rather than used, inherited or extended. Deprecation is a warning that the class or interface has been superseded, and will eventually be removed. The deprecation period allows you to make a smooth transition away from the aging, soon-to-be-retired technology.



**Noncompliant Code Example**

**错误的代码示例**

```
/**
 * @deprecated  As of release 1.3, replaced by {@link #Fee}
 */
@Deprecated
public class Fum { ... }

public class Foo {
  /**
   * @deprecated  As of release 1.7, replaced by {@link #doTheThingBetter()}
   */
  @Deprecated
  public void doTheThing() { ... }

  public void doTheThingBetter() { ... }
}

public class Bar extends Foo {
  public void doTheThing() { ... } // Noncompliant; don't override a deprecated method or explicitly mark it as @Deprecated
}

public class Bar extends Fum {  // Noncompliant; Fum is deprecated

  public void myMethod() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();  // okay; the class isn't deprecated
    foo.doTheThing();  // Noncompliant; doTheThing method is deprecated
  }
}
```
