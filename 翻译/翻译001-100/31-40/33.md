### 33."entrySet()" should be iterated when both the key and value are needed

集合类型的值不应该是可变的

`enum`s are generally thought of as constant, but an`enum`with a`public`field or`public`setter is not only non-constant, but also vulnerable to malicious code. Ideally fields in an`enum`are`private`and set in the constructor, but if that's not possible, their visibility should be reduced as much as possible.

**Noncompliant Code Example**

**错误的代码示例**

```
public enum Continent {

  NORTH_AMERICA (23, 24709000),
  // ...
  EUROPE (50, 39310000);

  public int countryCount;  // Noncompliant
  private int landMass;

  Continent(int countryCount, int landMass) {
    // ...
  }

  public void setLandMass(int landMass) {  // Noncompliant
    this.landMass = landMass;
  }
```


**Compliant Solution**

**正确的代码示例**

```
public enum Continent {

  NORTH_AMERICA (23, 24709000),
  // ...
  EUROPE (50, 39310000);

  private int countryCount;
  private int landMass;

  Continent(int countryCount, int landMass) {
    // ...
  }
```
