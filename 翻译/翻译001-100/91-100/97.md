### 97."static" members should be accessed statically

静态常量应该被静态访问

While it is_possible_to access`static`members from a class instance, it's bad form, and considered by most to be misleading because it implies to the readers of your code that there's an instance of the member per class instance.


**Noncompliant Code Example**

**错误的代码示例**

```
public class A {
  public static int counter = 0;
}

public class B {
  private A first = new A();
  private A second = new A();

  public void runUpTheCount() {
    first.counter ++;  // Noncompliant
    second.counter ++;  // Noncompliant. A.counter is now 2, which is perhaps contrary to expectations
  }
}
```

**Compliant Solution**

**正确的代码示例**


```
public class A {
  public static int counter = 0;
}

public class B {
  private A first = new A();
  private A second = new A();

  public void runUpTheCount() {
    A.counter ++;  // Compliant
    A.counter ++;  // Compliant
  }
}
```
